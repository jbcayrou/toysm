ToySM TODO list:

x python2 issues:
  - sched.run doesn't support the non-blocking variant
    => should be possible to work around the issue by defining
       a custom 'wait' function.
~ graph
~ debug
  1.one state instance
  2.one state class
  3.the entire fsm
  for 1 & 2, a decorator/function to be applied to class/instance much
  like the Trace used in the test classes.
  => for now only a Logger is defined (TBD if this is sufficient)
- threaded state
~ history states
  => DeepHistory not done yet
x s1>'x'>s2 doesn't work because it translates to s1 > 'x' and 'x'>s2...
  whereas (s1 > 'x') > s2 works and so does s1 > ('x' > s2) !!!!
  => resolved by using r/lshift operators
- multi-intance FSM:
  - a function is used to determine a key based on Events posted
    to event queue, each unknown key yields a new FSM, and those
    that yield a known key are processed by their specific FSM.
x replace on_entry by _on_entry and have the latter callback into an
  optional user defined on_enty. Same for on_exit/_on_exit.
- Allow State constructor to receive substates, e.g.
  State('s1', sub=[State('s2'), ...])
  => Builder idea
x Transition metaclass to register subclasses and associated
  compatible ctor arguments
x on_entry and on_exit should /also/ be called for toplevel state in FSM
? 'else' type guard
   => this could be achieved by having State.transitions be a list rather than
      a set, the 'else' clause would then be an unguarded transition that
      comes last in the list.
? get_*_transitions methods could _yield_ their result
* graph should treat Transitions according to their type (INTERNAL, EXTERNAL,
etc)
* graph: edge labels aren't positionned properly when source/target is a
         cluster (this is an issue with Graphviz)
- graph (optional): use a metaclass to have each subclass of DotMixin
         merge local attributes with those from superclasses. This would
         allow inheritance of all attributes that aren't locally overriden
         instead of forcing a complete redefinition of the 'dot' dictionary.
- rework get_enabled_transitions in State, possible to transfer logic
  for compound transitions to StateMachine
- create an Exception type and use it instead of asserts
- remove code used when a transition's source/target  is redefined, should
  simply considered an error/exception.
- implement StateMachine pause function
- support for event deferral
- support for Choice Pseudo States (i.e. Dynamic eval as opposed to static
  eval currently in place for Junctions)
- Add GPL file and GPL headers to .py files.
- Scapy integration (PacketTransition StateMachineBox)
- use 'public' decorator snippet to manage exported/public symbols
? remove DotMixin => functionality isn't used, replace it with a function
  to generate the attribute string based on the dot attribute of a node.
